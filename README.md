What is Dine-on-Time? 
-- Dine-on-Time is an enhancement for "Meal-in-a-Box" plans where the user orders a meal and all required ingredients are delivered in a box with printed cooking/preparation instructions.
-- The goal of the app is to utilize the individual user's personal device (e.g. phone or tablet) to:
  1) minimize the need for printed instructions. 
  2) take the worry out of cooking. The user is alerted when they need to take the next step in preparation.
  3) assist the user in serving their meal on schedule. This application allows the user to Dine-on-Time!

-- Dine-on-Time prompts the user to scan a unique QR code (or enter a Recipe ID#) which is included with the printed instructions and/or on the meal ingredients box. 
-- Upon scanning, the app asks when the user plans on serving the meal, then calculates when preparation should start. 
-- The app displays each step of the recipe with a "step timer" and audible alert. In addition, certain individual cooking items have a separate "cook timer" which sounds an audible alert when the item is nearly finished cooking.

** For demonstration purposes, the app contains instructions for 4 recipes; however, additional recipes can easily be added to the database. **
